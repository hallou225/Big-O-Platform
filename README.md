# Big-O-Platform
GOAL: This project aims to help students in introductory programming classes learn how to perform run-time complexity analysis in a practical way. Existing approaches for deriving the running time of an algorithm are done manually and can be difficult to self-check. We seek a more interactive and incremental approach that automatically checks a studentâ€™s work.
