# Big-O-Platform

**Introduction:**
  Our application is a learning management system that provides an intuitive interface for teachers to teach, and students to learn about, algorithm run-time complexity analysis using big-O notation. To use our application, a student would create a student account and join their teacher's class via a class code that the teacher must provide to the student. Teachers can create pages for the students to read or algorithms (via code upload and customization) for the students to complete.

**Release Notes:**
  Milestone 1: We finalized work on the server, setting up the database and the initial website configuration.
  Milestone 2: We developed a working teacher side of the application, ensuring it worked with our previous work.
  Milestone 3: We developed a working student side of the application, ensuring it worked with our previous work.
  Milestone 4: We implemented the logic and functionality for the algorithm upload and submission, implemented the page uploads, and tested that the teacher and student sides worked together as expected.
  Milestone 5: We finalized the project by gathering realistic data for the website, populating the database with the realistic data. We also fine tuned some details and styling before doing a final run-                 through of the application to make sure everything worked as expected.

  The code for the final result of our working application is in the main branch. Our other branches were used for organizing our work when developing the application.
