# Big-O-Platform
GOAL: This project aims to help students in introductory programming classes learn how to perform run-time complexity analysis in a practical way. Existing approaches for deriving the running time of an algorithm are done manually and can be difficult to self-check. We seek a more interactive and incremental approach that automatically checks a studentâ€™s work.

## Release Notes
* Skeleton of the website exists (but is not quite navigable yet)
  * Basic sign in page
  * Basic teacher page
  * Create account page
  * Create classes
* Separated out secret keys and database password for security
* Back end has been almost entirely set up
  * Git Action is the last major part beyond testing and ensuring there is always a live and working version of the page at all times
